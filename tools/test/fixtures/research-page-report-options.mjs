// The Research page's export-report call (src/research-benchmark.js) passes, for a
// project the page froze, the live provenance registry and ATTRIBUTIONS.md when this
// runtime carries them and the manifest of the export it would write for the same
// project, runtime and inputs; this fixture mirrors that case. For a project opened
// from an exported archive the page passes the archive's own manifest.json,
// provenance.json and ATTRIBUTIONS.md instead, exactly as the exported CLI reads them
// beside the project (see research-benchmark-open-exported-run.test.mjs). A
// browser-side stand-in compared with the exported CLI does the same; the CLI reads the
// export's own copies, so the two halves of that parity keep separate sources.
