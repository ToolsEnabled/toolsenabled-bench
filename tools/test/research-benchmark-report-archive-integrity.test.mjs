// A report for a project this build cannot rebuild.
//
// researchReportFiles calls verifyProject, which recompiles the frozen project
// with the current compiler and demands byte equality. That is right for a
// project frozen here. It is impossible for one opened from an archive that some
// other build froze: any change to compiled readiness output re-identifies every
// earlier frozen project. The exported command-line runner never meets this,
// because it runs from inside the archive and IS the pinned runtime; a page
// never is.
//
// So the page needs a second, explicitly labelled mode: render from bytes proved
// intact against the archive's own manifest, and say so in the report rather
// than claim a verification that did not happen. This is not a relaxation. The
// project's recorded digest must still match its own contents, so an edited
// answer key is refused exactly as before; what is dropped is the rebuild, and
// the report states that it was dropped and why.
