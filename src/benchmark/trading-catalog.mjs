export const OPERATIONAL_CONTRACT = `Draft operational equity contract, version 1. Personal review is required before freezing a study.
Each Strategy combines exactly four independently bound roles: buy reason, buy process, sell reason and sell process. Each Template owns 2–4 recursively typed Node children in declared slot order, with its own gate and reset properties. A strategy owns its private lots and tickets even when another strategy trades the same asset. Portfolio-wide holdings cannot determine private ownership. Cash is shared; accepted local purchase proposals reserve their full stated cash cap before later siblings run. Only native fills spend cash or change inventory. A cancellation request releases nothing until its terminal acknowledgment. Liquidating a losing branch or reset subtree cannot sell another owner's lot.
Visit each completed input bar once. All orders and cancellation requests are issued during that bar callback. Reconcile native receipts without issuing new orders from a receipt callback. A strategy takes at most one order action per bar. Evaluate its sell rule before a new entry; there is no same-bar re-entry. A strategy completes after it has actually bought, then becomes flat with all tickets terminal. Completion stays set until an explicit reset. A failed entry proposal may retry on a later bar.
Price predicates use observed completed closes only. Strict above/below excludes equality. Cross-up requires the preceding observed close at or below the threshold and the current close above; cross-down reverses that relation. SMA predicates include the current close and require the entire stated observation window. A missing price never supplies an observation or permits that asset's order. Holding age begins at the first actual entry fill: after N bars becomes true after N later completed timestamps. Arithmetic uses exact integer cents and whole shares. Fractional cash sizing floors quantity using unreserved cash and the observed price after the stated fee allowance; fixed cash sizing uses its stated budget. Fractional sales floor their fraction of available private inventory, with a minimum of one whole share.
ALL visits every eligible child in slot order and completes when all children complete. SEQUENCE visits only its current child; after actual child completion, the next child is eligible on the following completed bar. RACE acquisition is an explicit template policy: broker-accepted claims the first native accepted order (or fill proving acceptance), while first-fill permits contenders until an actual fill claims ownership. Slot order breaks same-callback opportunities. Losing branches cancel outstanding tickets, wait for terminal acknowledgment, then liquidate any actual losing inventory. The winning branch continues its lifecycle. RACE releases only after all branches are flat and terminal and any drain is complete; release/reactivation crosses a completed-bar boundary. No choice of RACE policy in this draft is personal approval of that policy for the study.
A state gate evaluates its predicate on each ready bar. An event gate declares a level or rising-edge trigger, an optional lifetime in completed bars, and an explicit rearm rule. An unready gate blocks entries without inventing a new transition. A closed gate either blocks new entries while exits continue, or drains and resets descendants, as its close policy declares. Reset takes priority over ordinary actions: cancel pending tickets, await terminal receipts, liquidate owned inventory when prices are available, then clear subtree state only when flat and terminal. Reactivation waits until a later timestamp. Reset of a child invalidates ancestor completion and rewinds an affected sequence; clearing an entire winning child releases its RACE ownership after draining. Reset preserves the requesting controller's trigger history, preventing a held rising-edge condition from repeatedly resetting itself.
The input explicitly chooses whether exits wait for entry tickets to become terminal or may sell currently owned quantity, and whether reset retains observed history or restarts that subtree's history. Gate event lifetime, rearming, drain state, winner, sequence cursor and holding age belong to their own node instance. Resource limits bound bars, proposals and receipts. A violated invariant stops qualification or execution. No implicit end-of-data liquidation occurs. This draft does not specify options lifecycle, margin, shorts, nonzero fees or live brokerage behavior.`
