// The condition language. One language, read at two moments.
//
// A reason evaluated once to choose a prompt and a reason evaluated over and
// over inside a running strategy are the same language; what differs is which
// facts are readable. At the generation moment the only facts are the row's own
// fields. At the run moment a child's lifecycle, its siblings, its own reason
// and elapsed time are readable too.
//
// A REASON DOES NOT CARRY ITS MOMENT. The moment comes from where the reason
// lives: a rule that chooses a composition is asked at generation, a policy on
// a container is asked at run. A reason holding a term its moment cannot read
// is refused by the name of the term, so there is nothing to label and nothing
// to keep in step.
//
// NOTHING HERE KNOWS A DOMAIN. The language says idle, active and done; what
// those mean for a body of work is the catalog's to say. No operator is defined
// in this file: the operators are ordinary content written in this language,
// and deleting every one of them leaves this file working.
