// report renders it as a "Layer map" table (report.mjs item 4). The Research
// page computed the same map and discarded it, so a person inspecting a task in
// the page could read the compiled prompt but could not see which bundle in the
// composition tree produced which span of it -- which is most of what reading a
// composed prompt is for.
//
// These source-map rows are built here once so the page and the report
// agree by construction instead of by two hand-written renderers drifting
// apart. Anything that wants the same markers elsewhere -- a per-attempt prompt
// in the evidence view, for instance -- should call this rather than write a
// second one.
